# node-web-server

This is a simple app that I made while following along with the course The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition) on Udemy. This app builds on node-weather-app - instead of providing an address via the command line, the user can do so in a webpage. Geocoding and weather APIs then retrieve the current weather forecast for that location which is displayed in the webpage.
